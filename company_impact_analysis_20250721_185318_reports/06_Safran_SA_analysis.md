### 2. Direct Impact Assessment

A Section 232 investigation could lead to tariffs on imports of commercial aircraft and jet engines, directly impacting Safran's significant US revenue exposure.

*   **Impact on Specific Products/Services:** Tariffs would primarily affect LEAP engines (via CFM International) and other aircraft systems (landing gear, nacelles, electrical systems) exported from France/Europe to the US. Given the LEAP engine's exclusivity on the Boeing 737 MAX and its substantial share on the Airbus A320neo, this is a critical vulnerability.
*   **Estimated Cost Increases or Revenue Losses:** Assuming the stated 75% revenue impact potential and a hypothetical tariff rate (e.g., 25%, as seen in other trade disputes), the direct financial impact could be substantial.
    *   **Revenue at Risk:** 75% of €27.317 billion = €20.488 billion.
    *   **Potential Tariff Cost (at 25%):** €20.488 billion * 0.25 = **€5.122 billion annually.**
    This cost would either be absorbed by Safran, passed to US customers (airlines, Boeing), or result in reduced sales volumes.
*   **Impact on Profit Margins, EBITDA, and Cash Flow:**
    *   **Profit Margins:** Direct tariffs would compress Safran's recurring operating income margin (15.1% in 2024) significantly, as the aerospace industry operates on long-term contracts with limited flexibility for price adjustments.
    *   **EBITDA:** A substantial increase in costs or reduction in revenue would directly erode EBITDA (€5.0 billion in 2024), impacting operational profitability.
    *   **Cash Flow:** Reduced profitability and potential working capital increases (e.g., if inventory builds due to slower US sales) would negatively affect free cash flow (€3.189 billion in 2024).
*   **Potential for Passing Costs to Customers:** Highly challenging. OEMs and airlines operate on tight margins and long-term agreements. Passing on significant tariff costs could lead to reduced orders, market share loss to non-tariffed competitors (e.g., Rolls-Royce for some engine types), or renegotiation demands. US industry groups have warned that tariffs would increase costs for US consumers and reduce the competitiveness of US products in export markets.

### 3. Strategic Response Options

Safran must proactively develop strategies to mitigate tariff impacts.

*   **Business Model Adjustments:**
    *   **Localization of Production:** Explore expanding or establishing manufacturing and assembly facilities within the US for key components or final assembly to circumvent tariffs. This is a long-term, capital-intensive solution but offers tariff immunity.
    *   **Shift in Sales Focus:** Intensify sales and marketing efforts in non-US markets (Europe, Asia-Pacific, Middle East) to offset potential declines in US revenue.
*   **Supply Chain Diversification Strategies:**
    *   **Non-US Sourcing:** Increase sourcing from non-US suppliers for critical components, particularly if tariffs lead to reciprocal actions or if US-origin components become more expensive.
    *   **Dual Sourcing:** Implement dual-sourcing strategies for critical parts to reduce reliance on any single geographic region or supplier.
*   **Geographic Expansion or Contraction:**
    *   **Expand Non-US MRO:** Further invest in MRO facilities outside the US to capture aftermarket revenue less exposed to US import tariffs.
    *   **Strategic Partnerships:** Strengthen existing partnerships (e.g., with GE in CFM International) to navigate trade complexities, potentially leveraging GE's US footprint.
*   **Product/Service Modifications:**
    *   **Cost Optimization:** Accelerate R&D and manufacturing process improvements to reduce unit costs, partially offsetting tariff impacts.
