## Detailed Analysis

## Equity Research Report: L3Harris Technologies, Inc. â€“ Impact of Section 232 Commercial Aircraft & Jet Engine Tariffs

**Date:** July 21, 2025

**Ticker:** LHX (NYSE)
**Current Revenue (FY2024):** $19.4 Billion (as per prompt)
**Revenue Impact Potential:** 20% (as per prompt, interpreted as maximum indirect impact)

### I. Executive Summary

L3Harris Technologies, Inc. (LHX) faces a nuanced risk from the ongoing Section 232 investigation into commercial aircraft, jet engines, and parts. While L3Harris recently completed the divestiture of its Commercial Aviation Solutions (CAS) business in March 2025 for $800 million, significantly reducing its direct exposure to commercial aviation product tariffs, the broader aerospace supply chain remains highly integrated and globalized. Consequently, potential tariffs could still indirectly impact L3Harris's predominantly defense-focused operations through increased costs for shared components, raw materials, and supply chain disruptions. We estimate a maximum indirect revenue impact of 20% ($3.88 billion) on total revenue, primarily stemming from potential cost escalations and operational inefficiencies across its defense segments due to a strained broader aerospace ecosystem. Investors should monitor supply chain resilience and L3Harris's strategic adjustments to mitigate these indirect pressures.

### II. Current Business Model

L3Harris Technologies is a global aerospace and defense technology innovator, delivering end-to-end solutions across air, land, sea, space, and cyber domains.
*   **Primary Products/Services:** Post-divestiture of CAS, L3Harris's core offerings include advanced electronics, communication systems, integrated mission systems, space and airborne systems, and rocket propulsion (via Aerojet Rocketdyne acquisition). While primarily defense-oriented, some segments, like Integrated Mission Systems, may involve "aircraft missionization volume" that could have dual-use or commercial spillover components.
*   **Key Customers & Markets:** Predominantly U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), international militaries, NASA, and major aerospace and defense prime contractors. Geographic scope is global, with customers in over 100 countries.
*   **Supply Chain Dependencies:** Highly complex and global, relying on specialized components, raw materials (e.g., semiconductors, advanced alloys), and sub-assemblies from a diverse network of suppliers. The aerospace sector's supply chain is characterized by deep cross-border integration.
*   **Competitive Position (Porter's Five Forces):**
    *   **Bargaining Power of Buyers (Moderate-High):** Dominated by large government entities (e.g., DoD) and prime contractors with significant purchasing power and stringent requirements.
    *   **Bargaining Power of Suppliers (Moderate):** Specialized components and raw materials can lead to concentrated supplier bases, but L3Harris's scale provides some leverage.
    *   **Threat of New Entrants (Low):** High barriers to entry due to significant R&D investment, regulatory hurdles, long certification cycles, and established customer relationships.
    *   **Threat of Substitutes (Low):** Highly specialized defense and aerospace technologies have few direct substitutes.
    *   **Intensity of Rivalry (High):** Competition from other major defense contractors (e.g., RTX, Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman) for government contracts and market share.

### III. Direct Impact Assessment

The Section 232 investigation targets "commercial aircraft and jet engines, and parts for commercial aircraft and jet engines". While L3Harris has divested its direct Commercial Aviation Solutions business, indirect impacts are plausible:
*   **Affected Products/Services (Indirect):** Tariffs on imported components (e.g., avionics components, semiconductors, sensors, communication systems, raw materials like aluminum and steel) could increase production costs for L3Harris's defense and dual-use products that share common supply chain elements with the commercial aerospace sector.
*   **Estimated Cost Increases or Revenue Losses (Quantitative):** Assuming the 20% "Revenue Impact Potential" refers to the maximum potential indirect impact on L3Harris's total revenue due to broad supply chain disruptions and cost escalations, this translates to a potential revenue at risk of **$3.88 billion** ($19.4 billion * 20%). This is a high-end estimate reflecting a severe disruption scenario. Tariffs on aerospace components have historically caused 6-11% rise in average production costs for avionics systems and could lead to an estimated annual cost increase of up to $5 billion for the U.S. aerospace industry broadly.
*   **Impact on Profit Margins, EBITDA, and Cash Flow:**
    *   **Profit Margins:** Given L3Harris's Q1 2025 adjusted segment operating margin of 15.6%, a significant increase in input costs (e.g., 6-11% on affected components) without full cost pass-through would compress gross and operating margins. A 20% revenue impact, if realized through cost increases, could reduce operating income by hundreds of millions to over a billion dollars, depending on the specific cost structure of affected products.
    *   **EBITDA:** Reduced operating income would directly translate to lower EBITDA.
    *   **Cash Flow:** Higher input costs and potential inventory build-up due to supply chain uncertainty could negatively impact working capital and free cash flow.
*   **Potential for Passing Costs to Customers:** Limited. Defense contracts often have fixed-price components or long-term agreements, making it challenging to immediately pass on unforeseen tariff-related cost increases. Competitive pressures in both defense and any remaining commercial segments also constrain pricing power.

### IV. Strategic Response Options

L3Harris's strategic responses would primarily focus on mitigating indirect supply chain risks:
*   **Business Model Adjustments:** Further emphasize core defense segments and capabilities less reliant on commercial aerospace supply chains. Accelerate "Trusted Disruptor" strategy focusing on agility and speed in defense.
*   **Supply Chain Diversification Strategies:**
    *   **Reshoring/Nearshoring:** Invest in domestic or allied-nation manufacturing capabilities for critical components to reduce reliance on potentially tariffed imports.
    *   **Dual-Sourcing:** Establish multiple qualified suppliers for key components to enhance resilience and reduce single-point-of-failure risks.
    *   **Vertical Integration:** Consider insourcing production of highly sensitive or tariff-prone components where feasible.
*   **Geographic Expansion or Contraction:** Focus on expanding defense sales to international allies with stable trade relationships, potentially reducing reliance on U.S.-centric supply chains for certain components.
*   **Product/Service Modifications:** Redesign products to utilize domestically sourced or tariff-exempt components and materials, or to reduce overall material intensity.

### V. Risk Factors

*   **Vulnerability to Supply Chain Disruptions:** Despite the CAS divestiture, L3Harris's defense segments likely share common raw materials and electronic components with the commercial aerospace industry. Tariffs could disrupt the broader supply chain, leading to delays, increased costs, and component shortages for L3Harris's defense products.
*   **Dependence on Specific Markets or Customers:** High reliance on U.S. government contracts means L3Harris is exposed to shifts in defense spending and procurement policies.
*   **Regulatory or Compliance Challenges:** The unpredictable nature of trade policy and potential retaliatory tariffs from other nations create significant uncertainty and compliance burdens.
*   **Competitive Threats or Opportunities:** Competitors with more diversified or localized supply chains might gain an advantage. Conversely, L3Harris's proactive supply chain management could become a competitive differentiator.

### VI. Long-term Implications

*   **Potential for Market Share Gains or Losses:** Proactive supply chain resilience and cost management could enable L3Harris to maintain or gain market share in the defense sector if competitors struggle with tariff impacts. Failure to adapt could lead to losses.
*   **Investment and Expansion Opportunities:** Increased R&D into tariff-proof designs, advanced manufacturing techniques (e.g., additive manufacturing for parts), and domestic production capabilities. Potential for strategic investments in key suppliers or technologies that enhance supply chain control.
*   **Strategic Partnerships or Acquisitions:** Formation of alliances with domestic suppliers or technology firms to secure critical inputs and reduce foreign dependencies.
*   **Innovation and R&D Implications:** A renewed focus on materials science, component miniaturization, and software-defined solutions to reduce reliance on physical, tariff-prone hardware.

### VII. Recommendations
