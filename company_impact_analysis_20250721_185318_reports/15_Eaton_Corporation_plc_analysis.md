### 2. Direct Impact Assessment

*   **Tariff Impact on Products/Services:** Tariffs on commercial aircraft and jet engines would directly increase the cost of Eaton's components and systems supplied to US-based commercial aircraft and engine manufacturers, or for aircraft imported into the US. This could affect both OEM sales and aftermarket services for affected platforms.
*   **Estimated Cost Increases/Revenue Losses:** Given a 10% potential revenue impact on Eaton's total annual revenue of $23.2 billion, this translates to a potential revenue loss of approximately **$2.32 billion**. [Provided Information] Assuming the Aerospace segment's Q1 2025 contribution of 15.05% ($3.49B of $23.2B total revenue), this 10% impact represents a significant portion of the Aerospace segment's revenue, implying either a substantial reduction in demand or a direct tariff cost passed through.
*   **Impact on Profit Margins, EBITDA, and Cash Flow:**
    *   Eaton's Aerospace segment focuses on high-margin markets. The company's overall gross profit margin was 38.5% in Q4 2024, and the Aerospace & Defense industry average gross margin is around 32.06%. Aerospace equipment OEMs typically have high EBIT margins (e.g., 13%).
    *   A $2.32 billion revenue reduction, assuming a 30-35% segment operating margin for aerospace, could lead to a **$696 million to $812 million reduction in operating profit**.
    *   This would directly impact EBITDA and cash flow. Eaton's Q4 2024 operating cash flow was $1.6 billion and free cash flow was $1.3 billion. A significant reduction in operating profit would proportionally decrease these figures, potentially by **20-30%** if the impact is concentrated and not fully mitigated.
*   **Potential for Passing Costs to Customers:** The ability to pass costs to customers (OEMs) is limited by the high bargaining power of buyers and long-term contracts. While some cost-plus contracts exist, competitive pressures and the desire to maintain market share may force Eaton to absorb a portion of the tariff burden, compressing margins.
