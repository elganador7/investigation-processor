**2. Direct Impact Assessment**

The US Department of Commerce initiated a Section 232 investigation on May 1, 2025, into imports of commercial aircraft, jet engines, and *parts for commercial aircraft and jet engines*, citing national security concerns. This investigation could lead to new tariffs or trade restrictions.

*   **Impact on Specific Products/Services:**
    *   **Indirect Impact (Demand-Side):** The primary threat to Brookhouse is a reduction in demand for new commercial aircraft and jet engines if tariffs are imposed on finished products. This would directly translate to fewer orders for new tooling, composite structures, and metallic components from major OEMs and Tier 1/2 suppliers. Given 95% revenue exposure, this is a critical vulnerability.
    *   **Direct Impact (Cost-Side):** If the investigation's scope extends to specialized tooling or components manufactured by Brookhouse and imported into the US, direct tariffs would increase the cost of Brookhouse's products for US customers, eroding competitiveness. The aerospace industry has already seen cost increases from prior Section 232 tariffs on steel and aluminum.
*   **Estimated Cost Increases or Revenue Losses (Quantitative):**
    *   Assuming a hypothetical 15% tariff on commercial aircraft and jet engine imports into the US, and a conservative estimate that this leads to a 10% reduction in global demand for new aircraft/engines (due to increased costs, reduced competitiveness, and potential retaliation), Brookhouse's revenue could decline by approximately 9.5% (10% of 95% exposed revenue).
    *   **Revenue Loss:** $35,000,000 * 0.095 = **$3,325,000**.
    *   In a more severe scenario, if tariffs directly impact Brookhouse's exports to the US (e.g., a 25% tariff on tooling components), and assuming 30% of the 95% exposed revenue is US-derived, this could lead to a direct cost increase for US customers. If Brookhouse absorbs half of this to remain competitive, it would impact $35M * 0.95 * 0.30 = $9.975M of revenue. The direct cost absorption would be $9.975M * 0.25 * 0.5 = **$1,246,875**.
*   **Impact on Profit Margins, EBITDA, and Cash Flow:**
    *   Assuming a typical aerospace manufacturing gross margin of 25% and an operating margin of 10%, a $3.325M revenue loss (demand-side scenario) would result in a **$831,250 reduction in gross profit** and a **$332,500 reduction in operating profit/EBITDA**, assuming fixed costs remain constant in the short term. This would significantly strain cash flow, particularly for a company of Brookhouse's size.
*   **Potential for Passing Costs to Customers:** Limited. The aerospace tooling market is competitive, and major primes/Tier 1/2 customers have strong bargaining power. Passing on tariff-related cost increases would likely lead to loss of market share or reduced order volumes. Industry bodies have warned that tariffs would "inject higher costs into the commercial aviation sector" and "weaken our economic and national security."
