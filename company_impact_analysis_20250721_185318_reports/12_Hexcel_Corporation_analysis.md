### 2. Direct Impact Assessment

The Section 232 investigation targets *imports* of commercial aircraft and jet engines, aiming to determine if they impair U.S. national security. While Hexcel is a U.S. manufacturer, the primary risk stems from potential retaliatory tariffs by other nations on U.S.-made aircraft and a general contraction in global aerospace demand.

*   **Impact on Specific Products/Services:** Tariffs on imported aircraft could lead to a shift in demand towards U.S.-made aircraft initially. However, the more significant threat is the imposition of retaliatory tariffs by major trading partners (e.g., EU, China) on U.S.-exported aircraft (Boeing). This would directly reduce global demand for new aircraft, impacting Hexcel's sales of carbon fiber, honeycomb, and resin systems to both Boeing and Airbus, as global production rates would likely decline.
*   **Estimated Cost Increases or Revenue Losses (Quantitative):**
    *   Given 85% revenue impact potential on $1.903 billion FY2024 revenue, approximately $1.618 billion of Hexcel's revenue is exposed to the commercial aerospace and defense sectors.
    *   A scenario of a 10-20% reduction in global commercial aircraft demand due to trade tensions and retaliatory tariffs could result in a revenue loss of $161.8 million to $323.6 million for Hexcel's aerospace segment.
    *   For context, Hexcel's 2024 net sales increased by 6.4% over 2023, with commercial aerospace sales up nearly 12%. A reversal of this growth would be significant.
*   **Impact on Profit Margins, EBITDA, and Cash Flow:**
    *   Hexcel's gross margin was 24.7% in FY2024, with adjusted operating income at 12.4% of sales and EBITDA margin at 16.30%.
    *   A revenue decline would severely compress these margins due to Hexcel's high fixed costs associated with R&D, specialized manufacturing facilities, and certifications.
    *   Assuming a 10-20% revenue decline in the affected segment, and a fixed cost base, the impact on operating income and EBITDA would be disproportionately larger. For example, a $161.8 million revenue loss could translate to a $40-80 million reduction in gross profit (assuming 25% gross margin), significantly impacting operating income and EBITDA.
    *   Reduced profitability would directly constrain operating cash flow, impacting capital allocation for R&D, share repurchases, and dividends.
*   **Potential for Passing Costs to Customers:** Limited. The aerospace industry operates on long-term contracts with stringent pricing, and OEMs are highly cost-sensitive. Hexcel's ability to pass on increased costs from reduced demand or supply chain inefficiencies would be minimal, likely leading to margin absorption.
