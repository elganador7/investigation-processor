### 2. Direct Impact Assessment

The Section 232 investigation, initiated by the U.S. Department of Commerce's Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS), aims to determine if imports of commercial aircraft, jet engines, and parts threaten U.S. national security, potentially leading to tariffs or other trade restrictions.

*   **Impact on Products/Services:** As a manufacturer of aerospace components and structures, TGI's operations would be directly affected by tariffs on imported raw materials (e.g., steel, aluminum) and components. This would increase the cost of goods sold for a significant portion of its portfolio.
*   **Estimated Cost Increases/Revenue Losses:** Given the stated 85% revenue impact potential on TGI's $1.26 billion annual revenue, approximately **$1.07 billion** of TGI's revenue stream is directly exposed to the outcome of this investigation. While specific tariff rates are unknown, industry estimates suggest tariffs could increase U.S. aerospace industry costs by up to $5 billion annually. For a company like TGI, this could translate into tens or hundreds of millions in increased operational costs, depending on the tariff rates and the proportion of imported inputs.
*   **Impact on Profit Margins, EBITDA, and Cash Flow:** Increased input costs from tariffs would directly compress TGI's profit margins. For FY2025, TGI reported an operating income of $139.4 million and an adjusted operating income of $170.4 million. A significant cost increase could substantially erode these figures. Under fixed-price contracts, TGI's ability to absorb these costs without passing them on would directly reduce EBITDA and free cash flow.
*   **Potential for Passing Costs to Customers:** While the aerospace industry may attempt to pass increased costs (e.g., 10%+ aircraft price increases) to airlines and ultimately passengers, weakening demand could limit this ability. TGI's long-term agreements often include provisions for inflation and material cost adjustments, which could offer some protection. However, the concentrated customer base (Boeing, Lockheed Martin) may exert pressure against full cost pass-through, impacting TGI's negotiating leverage.
