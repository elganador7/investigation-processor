**2. Direct Impact Assessment**

The Section 232 investigation targets *imports* of finished commercial aircraft and jet engines. While Sargent manufactures components, the impact on its business is primarily indirect but potentially severe due to its high exposure (90% revenue impact potential).

*   **Impact on Specific Products/Services:**
    *   **Indirect Demand Reduction:** If tariffs are imposed on imported aircraft/engines, it could lead to retaliatory tariffs from other countries on U.S.-made aircraft/engines. This would reduce global demand for U.S.-manufactured aircraft, directly impacting Sargent's customers (U.S. OEMs) and, consequently, Sargent's order volumes for bearings and hydraulic assemblies.
    *   **Cost Increases (Indirect):** While the investigation is on finished products, a broader trade war could lead to tariffs on raw materials (e.g., steel, aluminum, specialized alloys) or sub-components that Sargent imports, increasing its Cost of Goods Sold (COGS).
    *   **Competitive Disadvantage:** If U.S.-made aircraft become more expensive globally due to retaliatory tariffs, non-U.S. aircraft manufacturers (and their component suppliers) could gain market share, potentially shifting demand away from Sargent's U.S.-based customers.
*   **Estimated Quantitative Impact:**
    *   Assuming the 90% revenue impact potential translates to direct exposure to the commercial aerospace market, $180 million ($200M * 0.90) of Sargent's revenue is at risk.
    *   **Scenario 1 (Moderate Impact):** A 10% reduction in demand for U.S.-made commercial aircraft due to tariffs could result in a revenue loss of approximately $18 million ($180M * 0.10).
    *   **Scenario 2 (Severe Impact):** A 20% reduction in demand could lead to a revenue loss of $36 million ($180M * 0.20).
    *   **Profit Margins, EBITDA, and Cash Flow:** Given the high fixed costs typical in aerospace manufacturing, even a moderate revenue decline would significantly compress profit margins. Assuming a pre-tax profit margin of 10-15% (typical for specialized manufacturing), a $18M revenue loss could translate to a $1.8M-$2.7M reduction in pre-tax profit. EBITDA would decline proportionally, impacting operating cash flow and potentially limiting capital expenditures or debt servicing capacity.
*   **Potential for Passing Costs to Customers:** Low. The aerospace sector is characterized by long-term contracts, intense price competition, and strong buyer power. Passing on cost increases due to tariffs is challenging and could lead to loss of business to competitors.
