### 2. Direct Impact Assessment

The Section 232 investigation, initiated on May 1, 2025, aims to determine if imports of commercial aircraft, jet engines, and parts threaten U.S. national security, potentially leading to tariffs or other trade restrictions. While MRO Electronics sells "overseas-only," its 95% revenue impact potential indicates significant indirect exposure through its customers who export to the U.S. [Company Information].

*   **Impact on Products/Services:** Tariffs on commercial aircraft and jet engines imported into the U.S. would directly increase costs for MRO's non-U.S. customers who sell into the U.S. market. This would likely lead to reduced demand for MRO's components, pressure for price concessions, or a shift by customers to non-tariffed suppliers or domestic U.S. alternatives.
*   **Estimated Quantitative Impact:**
    *   **At-Risk Revenue:** 95% of $12,500,000 = $11,875,000 [Company Information].
    *   **Assumptions:** For a specialized aerospace component manufacturer, we assume a Gross Margin (GM) of 30% and an EBITDA Margin (EBITDAM) of 15%. (Industry averages for Aerospace & Defense Gross Margin range from ~28-40%, and EBITDA Margin averages around 12.6%).
    *   **Scenario 1 (Moderate Impact - 20% Revenue Reduction):**
        *   Revenue Loss: $11,875,000 * 20% = $2,375,000
        *   Gross Profit Loss: $2,375,000 * 30% = $712,500
        *   EBITDA Loss: $2,375,000 * 15% = $356,250
    *   **Scenario 2 (Severe Impact - 50% Revenue Reduction):**
        *   Revenue Loss: $11,875,000 * 50% = $5,937,500
        *   Gross Profit Loss: $5,937,500 * 30% = $1,781,250
        *   EBITDA Loss: $5,937,500 * 15% = $890,625
*   **Impact on Profit Margins, EBITDA, and Cash Flow:** Any revenue reduction directly translates to a significant decline in gross profit, EBITDA, and operating cash flow, given the high fixed costs associated with specialized manufacturing and R&D in aerospace.
*   **Potential for Passing Costs to Customers:** Low. Customers facing their own tariff burdens will likely resist price increases and may seek to renegotiate existing contracts or explore alternative suppliers to mitigate their costs.
