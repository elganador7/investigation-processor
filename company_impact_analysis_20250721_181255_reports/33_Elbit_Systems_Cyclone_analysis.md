### 2. Direct Impact Assessment

The US Department of Commerce initiated a Section 232 investigation on May 1, 2025, to determine if imports of commercial aircraft, jet engines, and parts threaten US national security. This investigation could lead to the imposition of new tariffs or other trade restrictions.

*   **How Tariffs Would Affect Specific Products/Services:**
    The investigation directly targets "commercial aircraft and jet engines, and parts for commercial aircraft and jet engines." This directly impacts Cyclone's significant commercial aerospace business, including its critical aerostructure parts for the Boeing 787 and the newly secured Main Deck Cargo Door contract for the Boeing 777/777-8F freighters. Tariffs would increase the cost of these imported components for US-based OEMs like Boeing. Even US-designed parts manufactured abroad and reimported into the US aftermarket supply chain could be subject to tariffs.

*   **Estimated Cost Increases or Revenue Losses:**
    The prompt indicates a "Revenue Impact Potential: 90%." This suggests that a substantial majority of Cyclone's revenue derived from its commercial aerospace activities, particularly those involving exports to the US or US-based OEMs, is at risk. While specific revenue figures for Cyclone are not publicly disaggregated from Elbit Systems Ltd.'s overall financials (which reported $6.8 billion in revenues for 2024), the 90% potential impact implies a severe financial hit to Cyclone's commercial segment. Tariffs directly increase acquisition costs; for example, a 10% tariff on a $100,000 component adds $10,000 to the cost. Such increases would ripple through the supply chain, affecting both Cyclone and its OEM customers.

*   **Impact on Profit Margins:**
    Increased costs due to tariffs, whether on raw materials or finished components, would directly compress Cyclone's profit margins. If Cyclone is unable to fully pass these increased costs onto its customers, its profitability would decline. Major aerospace component manufacturers like RTX and GE Aerospace are already anticipating multi-million dollar tariff impacts, highlighting the industry-wide pressure.

*   **Potential for Passing Costs to Customers:**
    While Cyclone might attempt to pass on increased costs to its OEM customers (e.g., Boeing, Spirit AeroSystems), the ability to do so is constrained by market dynamics. OEMs themselves face increased manufacturing costs and competitive pressures, which could limit their willingness or ability to absorb higher prices from suppliers. Weakening demand in the commercial aviation sector, potentially exacerbated by higher aircraft prices, could further erode pricing power.
