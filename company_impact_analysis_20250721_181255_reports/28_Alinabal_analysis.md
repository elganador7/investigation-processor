### 2. Direct Impact Assessment

The "Revenue Impact Potential: 70%" is a critical indicator, suggesting that approximately $59.5 million (70% of $85 million annual revenue) of Alinabal's revenue is directly tied to or significantly influenced by the commercial aircraft and jet engine sector.

**How Tariffs Would Affect Their Specific Products/Services:**
While the Section 232 investigation targets *imported* commercial aircraft and jet engines, the broader implications for the aerospace industry could significantly impact Alinabal.
*   **Increased Costs for U.S. Customers:** If tariffs are imposed on imported aircraft and engines, U.S. aircraft manufacturers (Alinabal's customers) might face increased costs for any imported sub-components or raw materials they use, or they might face retaliatory tariffs on their exports. This could lead to higher overall production costs for U.S.-made aircraft, potentially reducing their competitiveness in the global market and leading to lower demand for new aircraft.
*   **Supply Chain Disruptions:** The aerospace industry relies on a complex global supply chain. Tariffs can fragment these supply chains, leading to increased lead times and potential shortages of critical components, even for U.S. manufacturers. This could disrupt Alinabal's customers' production schedules, subsequently impacting demand for Alinabal's components.
*   **Reduced Demand for New Aircraft:** Higher costs for airlines due to tariffs could lead to a reduction in new aircraft orders globally, affecting both U.S. and international manufacturers. A contraction in the overall commercial aerospace market would directly reduce demand for Alinabal's specialized components.
*   **Potential for Increased Domestic Sourcing (Offsetting Factor):** Conversely, tariffs on imported aircraft *could* theoretically incentivize U.S. aircraft manufacturers to increase domestic production and sourcing, potentially benefiting Alinabal as a U.S.-based supplier. However, the industry has warned that such tariffs could weaken the economic and national security of the commercial aviation sector by injecting higher costs. Major U.S. OEMs have expressed opposition to Section 232 measures, advocating for a tariff-free regime, highlighting the global nature of their supply chains.

**Estimated Cost Increases or Revenue Losses:**
Assuming the 70% revenue impact potential signifies a downside risk, Alinabal could face a significant reduction in revenue from its commercial aerospace segment. If the market contracts or their customers face severe cost pressures, this $59.5 million in revenue is at risk. The actual loss would depend on the severity and duration of any tariffs and the resulting market reaction. For instance, if the tariffs lead to a 10% reduction in demand within the impacted segment, Alinabal could see a revenue loss of approximately $5.95 million (10% of $59.5 million).

**Impact on Profit Margins:**
Any revenue loss would directly impact profit margins. Furthermore, if Alinabal's own input costs (e.g., for superalloys or specialized machinery) increase due to tariffs on those materials, or if supply chain disruptions lead to higher procurement costs, their profit margins would be further squeezed. The aerospace supply chain is already described as "fragile," and suppliers may be unable to pass on increased costs due to contractual obligations.

**Potential for Passing Costs to Customers:**
Alinabal's ability to pass on increased costs to its customers would depend on several factors:
*   **Contractual Obligations:** Existing long-term contracts with OEMs might limit their ability to immediately adjust prices.
*   **Competitive Landscape:** In a competitive market, passing on costs could lead to a loss of market share to competitors, especially if those competitors are less affected by the tariffs or have more diversified supply chains.
*   **Customer Willingness:** OEMs facing their own cost pressures might resist price increases from suppliers.
