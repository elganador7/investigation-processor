### 1. Current Business Model

**Primary Products/Services:**
Leonardo's business is diversified across several divisions: Helicopters, Aircraft, Aerostructures, Electronics, and Cybersecurity.
*   **Aerostructures (3.7% of net sales in 2024):** Leonardo is a key partner for leading commercial aircraft manufacturers, specializing in the production and assembly of major structural composite and metallic components. This includes significant contributions to programs like the Boeing 787 Dreamliner (14% of the aircraft, including central and rear-central fuselage sections and horizontal stabilizer), Airbus A220 (horizontal and vertical stabilizer), and Airbus A321 (forward fuselage section).
*   **Aircraft (15.4% of net sales in 2024):** Leonardo designs, develops, produces, maintains, and upgrades commercial, military, and military training aircraft. A significant part of its commercial aircraft business is through the ATR consortium, a 50/50 joint venture with Airbus. ATR is a leading manufacturer of turboprop regional aircraft (ATR 42 and 72), for which Leonardo produces the entire fuselage and tail stabilizers.
*   **Helicopters (29.5% of net sales in 2024):** Leonardo is a global leader in the helicopter market, producing a wide range of commercial and defense helicopters across various weight categories. Their commercial helicopters are used for VIP/corporate transport, energy services (offshore), search and rescue, and law enforcement. Leonardo holds a strong position in the commercial helicopter market, particularly in Europe, where it leads with a 44% share of the multi-engine VIP/Corporate helicopter fleet.
*   **Other Divisions:** While the investigation specifically targets commercial aircraft and jet engines, Leonardo also has substantial operations in defense systems (39.7%), space systems (5%), cybersecurity (3.3%), and other areas, which are less directly exposed to this specific tariff threat.

**Key Customers and Markets:**
Leonardo serves a global customer base, including governments, defense agencies, institutions, and commercial enterprises. Its commercial aerospace customers include major aircraft manufacturers like Boeing and Airbus (through the ATR joint venture), as well as numerous airlines and helicopter operators worldwide. Leonardo has a significant industrial presence in four domestic markets: Italy, the UK, the USA, and Poland. In the US, Leonardo operates through Leonardo Corporation and Leonardo DRS, with nearly 8,000 employees.

**Supply Chain Dependencies:**
Leonardo's supply chain is extensive, spanning 77 countries and comprising 11,000 companies, with €9.9 billion in annual purchases. The company has a strong focus on building a resilient and digitally integrated supply chain through programs like "Leap" and "AirSupply," which involve over 5,000 suppliers, 87% of which are SMEs. Key procurement is concentrated in Italy, the UK, the US, and Poland. Leonardo relies on a network of suppliers for components, raw materials (e.g., composite materials for aerostructures), and specialized services.

**Competitive Position:**
Leonardo holds leadership positions in several key sectors, including civil helicopters, trainers, radar, and naval guns. In commercial aerospace, its aerostructures division is a partner to global leaders like Boeing and Airbus, indicating a strong, albeit sometimes challenging, competitive standing. The ATR joint venture is a market leader in regional turboprop aircraft. While strong in defense, its civil aerospace exposure is noted as a weakness in some analyses. The company has been working to improve the profitability of its aerostructures business.

### 2. Direct Impact Assessment

The Section 232 investigation targets imports of "commercial aircraft and jet engines." Based on Leonardo's business model, the most directly impacted segments would be:

*   **Aerostructures:** Leonardo's significant role as a supplier of fuselage sections and stabilizers for Boeing 787, Airbus A220, and A321 aircraft means that any tariffs on these components or the finished aircraft entering the US would directly affect its revenue from these programs. Given that Boeing is a US-based manufacturer, tariffs on components supplied to Boeing for aircraft assembled in the US could lead to increased costs for Boeing, potentially prompting them to seek alternative, non-tariffed suppliers or demand price reductions from Leonardo.
*   **Aircraft (ATR Joint Venture):** While ATR turboprops are regional aircraft, if they are classified under "commercial aircraft" and imported into the US, they could face tariffs. Leonardo produces the entire fuselage and tail stabilizers for ATR aircraft.
*   **Commercial Helicopters:** Although the investigation specifically mentions "commercial aircraft and jet engines," the definition of "aircraft" can sometimes be broad. If commercial helicopters are included, Leonardo's strong commercial helicopter business, including sales to North America, could be affected.

**Estimated Cost Increases or Revenue Losses:**
The prompt states a "Revenue Impact Potential: 35%." This figure suggests a significant portion of Leonardo's total revenue could be at risk if tariffs are broadly applied and severely impact its commercial aerospace segments. Given Leonardo's 2024 revenue of €17.8 billion (approximately $19.06 billion), a 35% impact would equate to a potential revenue loss of approximately **$6.67 billion**.

This 35% potential impact likely encompasses the revenue generated from its aerostructures division (3.7% of net sales) and a portion of its aircraft division (15.4% of net sales) that relates to commercial programs (like ATR and Airbus components), as well as potentially commercial helicopters (29.5% of net sales) if they fall under the scope. The aerostructures division, in particular, has been struggling, posting a €151 million loss in 2024, making it highly vulnerable to additional cost pressures.

**Impact on Profit Margins:**
Tariffs would directly increase the cost of Leonardo's products or components sold into the US market.
*   **Increased Cost of Goods Sold (COGS):** If tariffs are imposed on Leonardo's exports to the US, the cost for US buyers would increase.
*   **Reduced Competitiveness:** This would make Leonardo's products less competitive against domestic US suppliers or suppliers from countries not subject to tariffs.
*   **Pressure on Pricing:** To maintain market share, Leonardo might be forced to absorb a portion of the tariff costs, leading to a direct reduction in profit margins. This is particularly critical for the aerostructures division, which is already unprofitable.

**Potential for Passing Costs to Customers:**
The ability to pass costs to customers depends on several factors:
*   **Contractual Agreements:** Existing long-term contracts with major OEMs like Boeing and Airbus might have clauses that dictate how cost changes, including tariffs, are handled. Some repricing agreements have been made with Boeing in 2024.
*   **Market Power and Competition:** In a highly competitive aerospace market, passing on full tariff costs can be challenging. Customers like Boeing and Airbus have significant leverage.
*   **Product Uniqueness:** If Leonardo's components or aircraft offer unique capabilities or are deeply integrated into customer production lines (e.g., the 787 fuselage sections), there might be some ability to pass on costs. However, for more commoditized parts or where alternatives exist, this would be difficult.
*   **Customer's End Market:** If the end product (e.g., a Boeing 787) is sold into a global market, the US tariff might be absorbed across the entire sales base, diluting the impact. However, if the end product is primarily for the US market, the pressure to absorb costs would be higher.

Given the current struggles of the aerostructures unit and the competitive nature of the commercial aerospace sector, it is likely that Leonardo would have to absorb a significant portion of any tariff costs, further eroding already thin or negative margins in affected segments.

### 3. Strategic Response Options

**Potential Business Model Adjustments:**
*   **Shift Focus to Defense/Security:** Leonardo could strategically de-emphasize its commercial aerospace exposure, particularly in aerostructures, and further pivot towards its more robust defense and security segments, which constitute a larger portion of its revenue and are less susceptible to commercial aircraft tariffs.
*   **Increase US Manufacturing Footprint:** To circumvent tariffs, Leonardo could explore expanding its manufacturing capabilities within the United States for components or sub-assemblies destined for US customers. Leonardo already has a significant presence in the US through Leonardo DRS and other operations. This would require substantial capital investment but could secure long-term access to the US market.
*   **Focus on Aftermarket Services:** Emphasizing higher-margin customer support and MRO (Maintenance, Repair, and Overhaul) services for its existing commercial helicopter and aircraft fleet could provide a more stable revenue stream less directly impacted by new tariffs on new aircraft sales.

**Supply Chain Diversification Strategies:**
*   **Nearshoring/Reshoring:** Leonardo could increase its reliance on European or Italian suppliers for components currently sourced from or destined for the US, reducing vulnerability to US tariffs.
*   **Dual Sourcing:** For critical components, developing alternative suppliers outside the US or from non-tariffed countries would reduce dependence on a single supply chain vulnerable to trade disputes.
*   **Leveraging Digital Supply Chain Tools:** Leonardo's existing "AirSupply" platform and "Leap" program, which focus on digital integration and supplier resilience, can be further utilized to identify and onboard alternative suppliers more efficiently and manage potential disruptions.
*   **Additive Manufacturing (AM):** Leonardo is already exploring AM for spare parts and ground support equipment. Expanding AM capabilities could reduce reliance on traditional supply chains for certain components, enabling on-demand production and reducing lead times, thereby mitigating some supply chain risks.

**Geographic Expansion or Contraction:**
*   **Diversify Commercial Sales Away from US:** While the US is a major market, Leonardo could intensify efforts to grow commercial aircraft and helicopter sales in other regions (e.g., Asia-Pacific, Middle East, Europe) to reduce its reliance on the US market for these specific products.
*   **Strategic Partnerships in Non-US Markets:** Forming stronger partnerships or joint ventures in other regions for commercial aerospace production could help mitigate US tariff impacts.

**Product/Service Modifications:**
*   **Focus on Non-Tariffed Components:** If tariffs are highly specific, Leonardo could adjust its product mix to focus on components or services less likely to be targeted.
*   **Innovation in Materials and Design:** Investing in R&D to develop new materials or designs that reduce reliance on specific imported components or allow for more localized production could be a long-term strategy.
