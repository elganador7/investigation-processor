### 2. Direct Impact Assessment

The Section 232 investigation into commercial aircraft and jet engines, initiated on May 1, 2025, by the U.S. Department of Commerce, aims to determine if imports in this sector threaten U.S. national security. If the investigation concludes that such a threat exists, the President could impose tariffs or other import restrictions. Given that previous Section 232 investigations on steel and aluminum resulted in 25% tariffs, a similar outcome for commercial aircraft and jet engine parts is a tangible risk.

**How Tariffs Would Affect Scot Forge's Specific Products/Services:**
Scot Forge provides "critical forged metal solutions from rocket bulkheads and engine-attach rings on jet aircraft". These are direct components within the scope of the investigation.
*   **Increased Raw Material Costs:** Even if Scot Forge primarily sources raw materials domestically, the global nature of metal markets means that tariffs on imported commercial aircraft and jet engines could indirectly drive up the cost of specialty metals (e.g., titanium, nickel-based alloys) used in aerospace forgings, as seen with previous steel and aluminum tariffs.
*   **Reduced Demand from OEMs:** Major U.S. aerospace OEMs (Original Equipment Manufacturers) like Boeing, RTX Corporation, and GE Aerospace have strongly opposed potential Section 232 tariffs, warning of increased operational costs and supply chain disruptions. If tariffs are imposed on finished aircraft or engines, it could lead to reduced production volumes or delayed orders from these key customers, directly impacting Scot Forge's demand for aerospace forgings. The aerospace supply chain is rigid, with long lead times (up to 10 years) to qualify new suppliers, meaning OEMs cannot easily switch to alternative component providers if costs rise significantly.
*   **Competitive Disadvantage (if tariffs are not reciprocal):** If tariffs are imposed by the U.S. but not reciprocated by other countries, or if they disproportionately affect U.S. exports, it could make U.S.-manufactured aircraft and components more expensive globally, potentially shifting demand to foreign competitors and reducing export opportunities for Scot Forge's customers, and by extension, for Scot Forge itself.

**Estimated Cost Increases or Revenue Losses:**
The prompt states a "Revenue Impact Potential: 60%" for Scot Forge from the aerospace sector. With an annual revenue of $200,000,000, this means approximately $120,000,000 of Scot Forge's revenue is exposed to the aerospace market.
*   **Direct Revenue Loss:** If tariffs lead to a significant downturn in U.S. commercial aircraft and jet engine production or a shift in sourcing by OEMs, Scot Forge could see a substantial portion of this $120 million revenue stream at risk. A 10% reduction in aerospace-related demand due to tariffs could translate to a $12 million revenue loss for Scot Forge.
*   **Input Cost Increases:** Previous tariffs on steel and aluminum led to aluminum premiums shooting up almost 60%. If similar or higher tariffs are applied to other critical aerospace metals or if existing tariffs are exacerbated, Scot Forge could face significant increases in its raw material costs. For a manufacturing company, even a 5-10% increase in raw material costs can substantially erode margins if not passed on.

**Impact on Profit Margins:**
Increased raw material costs and potential reductions in order volumes would directly compress Scot Forge's profit margins. The aerospace industry's supply chain is characterized by high quality standards and long qualification processes, making it difficult for OEMs to absorb cost increases or quickly switch suppliers. This pressure on OEMs would likely translate into pressure on their suppliers, including Scot Forge, to absorb some of the increased costs.

**Potential for Passing Costs to Customers:**
Scot Forge's ability to pass on increased costs to its customers depends on several factors:
*   **Contractual Agreements:** Existing long-term contracts with aerospace OEMs may have fixed pricing or limited escalation clauses, making it difficult to immediately pass on cost increases.
*   **Market Power:** As an "industry leader" and a supplier of "critical forged metal solutions", Scot Forge likely possesses some degree of pricing power, especially for highly specialized or proprietary components where alternatives are limited. The aerospace industry notes that "many of their parts are sole source, meaning no other manufacturer is available, and the lead time to qualify a new source could take years". This rigidity could allow for some cost pass-through.
*   **Customer Willingness:** OEMs are already facing pressure from tariffs. Their willingness to accept higher prices from Scot Forge would depend on the overall market conditions, their own cost structures, and the criticality of Scot Forge's components. Ultimately, these costs could be passed down the value chain to airlines and the flying public.

### 3. Strategic Response Options

Scot Forge can implement several strategic responses to mitigate the impact of potential tariffs:

**Potential Business Model Adjustments:**
*   **Enhanced Cost Management:** Implement aggressive internal cost reduction programs across all operations, from manufacturing processes (e.g., leveraging near-net shaping capabilities to reduce material waste) to administrative overhead.
*   **Value-Added Services Expansion:** Further emphasize and expand their value-added services (heat treatment, machining, testing) to differentiate themselves and capture more margin within the value chain, making their offerings indispensable to customers.
*   **Focus on Defense Sector:** While aerospace is a significant portion, Scot Forge also serves the defense industry, including the U.S. Navy. The defense sector might be less susceptible to commercial trade tariffs, or even see increased domestic demand if national security concerns are heightened. Shifting resources or marketing efforts to this segment could provide a buffer.

**Supply Chain Diversification Strategies:**
*   **Increased Domestic Sourcing:** Scot Forge already emphasizes domestic sourcing to reduce supply chain risks. This strategy should be intensified for critical raw materials and sub-components to minimize exposure to import tariffs and global trade tensions. This aligns with the broader U.S. government's push for domestic capacity.
*   **Strategic Partnerships with Raw Material Suppliers:** Forge deeper, long-term strategic partnerships with U.S.-based raw material suppliers to secure stable pricing and supply, potentially through long-term contracts or joint development efforts.
*   **Inventory Management:** Optimize inventory levels for critical raw materials to buffer against short-term supply disruptions and price volatility caused by tariffs.

**Geographic Expansion or Contraction:**
*   **Focus on U.S. Operations:** Given the "America First" nature of Section 232 investigations and Scot Forge's identity as a 100% employee-owned American manufacturer, a contraction of reliance on foreign markets for *inputs* (if any significant ones exist) and a reinforcement of U.S. manufacturing capabilities would be prudent. Their five U.S. facilities and two joint ventures provide a strong domestic base.
*   **Evaluate Export Markets:** While the investigation targets imports *into* the U.S., retaliatory tariffs from other countries could impact U.S. aerospace exports. Scot Forge should monitor global trade relations and assess the viability of certain export markets for its components if the overall U.S. aerospace export market contracts.

**Product/Service Modifications:**
*   **Material Substitution Research:** Invest in R&D to explore alternative, domestically available materials or new forging techniques that could reduce reliance on potentially tariff-affected imported alloys, without compromising performance or certifications.
*   **Design for Manufacturability (DFM) Collaboration:** Work even more closely with customers on DFM principles, leveraging their near-net shaping capabilities to reduce material input and machining costs for customers, thereby offering a cost advantage even if raw material prices rise.
*   **Expand into Non-Aerospace Critical Forgings:** While aerospace is significant, Scot Forge's expertise in critical forgings extends to other sectors like nuclear, mining, and oil & gas. Actively pursuing growth in these less tariff-sensitive sectors could help diversify revenue away from the directly impacted aerospace segment.

### 4. Risk Factors

**Vulnerability to Supply Chain Disruptions:**
*   **Raw Material Availability and Cost:** Despite efforts to source domestically, the specialized nature of aerospace-grade metals means that global supply chain disruptions or tariffs on *any* part of the metal production process (e.g., mining, smelting, initial processing) could impact Scot Forge's access to or cost of essential raw materials. The aerospace industry emphasizes that "the industry cannot rapidly replace suppliers without creating significant cost overruns, supply chain bottlenecks, and safety risks".
*   **Long Lead Times:** The aerospace supply chain is characterized by long lead times for parts, some exceeding two years, and is not easily transferable geographically due to stringent regulatory constraints. Any disruption could lead to significant production delays for Scot Forge and its customers.
