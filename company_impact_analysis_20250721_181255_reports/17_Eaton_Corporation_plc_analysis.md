### 2. Direct Impact Assessment

The Section 232 investigation into commercial aircraft and jet engines could significantly impact Eaton's Aerospace segment.

*   **How tariffs would affect their specific products/services:**
    *   **Reduced Demand:** Tariffs on imported commercial aircraft and jet engines into the US would likely increase their cost, potentially leading to a decrease in demand for new aircraft from US airlines and other buyers. Since Eaton supplies critical components to major aircraft and engine OEMs (e.g., Boeing, GE Aviation, Rolls-Royce, Pratt & Whitney), a slowdown in aircraft production or sales would directly translate to reduced orders for Eaton's aerospace products.
    *   **Increased Input Costs:** If tariffs are imposed on specific components or raw materials that Eaton imports for its aerospace manufacturing, this would directly increase Eaton's cost of goods sold. While Eaton has a global manufacturing footprint with ten factories worldwide, the specific origin of components and raw materials used in its US-bound aerospace products would determine the direct tariff exposure.
    *   **Supply Chain Disruption:** The uncertainty and potential for tariffs could lead to disruptions in the global aerospace supply chain as OEMs and suppliers adjust their strategies, potentially impacting Eaton's production schedules and delivery timelines.

*   **Estimated Cost Increases or Revenue Losses:**
    *   The user-provided "Revenue Impact Potential: 17.5%" is significant. Assuming this percentage applies to Eaton's total annual revenue of $24.88 billion, the potential revenue at risk across the entire company would be approximately $4.35 billion. However, given the investigation is specific to "Commercial Aircraft and Jet Engines," it is more appropriate to apply this potential impact to Eaton's Aerospace segment revenue.
    *   Eaton's Aerospace segment sales were $979 million in Q1 2025. While a full annual aerospace revenue figure for 2024 isn't explicitly stated in the provided snippets, based on Q1 2025 data, the annual run rate would be approximately $3.9 billion ($979M * 4). In 2024, the aerospace segment's sales were 23% to four large OEMs. If we consider the 17.5% revenue impact potential specifically on the Aerospace segment's estimated annual revenue of approximately $3.9 billion, the potential revenue loss for the Aerospace segment could be around **$682.5 million annually**. This is a substantial figure for a segment that generated $979 million in Q1 2025.
    *   The actual impact would depend on the scope and magnitude of the tariffs, the ability of OEMs to absorb or pass on costs, and the elasticity of demand for commercial aircraft.

*   **Impact on Profit Margins:**
    *   Increased input costs due to tariffs, coupled with potential revenue declines from reduced demand, would put significant pressure on Eaton's profit margins within the Aerospace segment.
    *   Eaton's Aerospace segment operating margins were strong at 18.6% in Q1 2025. A 17.5% revenue impact, if not offset by cost reductions or price increases, would severely erode these margins.
    *   The aerospace segment is considered a high-margin business for Eaton, and any significant negative impact here could disproportionately affect the company's overall profitability, despite its diversification.

*   **Potential for Passing Costs to Customers:**
    *   Eaton's ability to pass on increased costs to its major OEM customers would depend on contractual agreements, the competitive landscape, and the overall demand environment.
    *   In a highly competitive market with established relationships, passing on costs might be challenging without risking market share. However, given Eaton's strong competitive position and the critical nature of its components, it may have some leverage.
    *   Long-term contracts with OEMs might limit immediate price adjustments, but future contract negotiations would likely reflect the new cost environment.
