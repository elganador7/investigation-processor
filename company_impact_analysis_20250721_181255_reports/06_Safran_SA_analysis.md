### Executive Summary

Safran S.A., a French multinational aerospace, defense, and security corporation, faces significant potential headwinds from a recently initiated Section 232 investigation by the US Department of Commerce concerning imports of commercial aircraft and jet engines and parts. While Safran's direct revenue from the United States accounts for approximately 25% of its total sales, the provided "Revenue Impact Potential" of 85% suggests a much broader exposure, likely due to the global nature of the aerospace supply chain and the integration of Safran's components into aircraft manufactured by major US original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) like Boeing, which are then sold worldwide. The imposition of tariffs or other restrictions could lead to increased costs, reduced profit margins, and potential shifts in market dynamics, despite Safran's stated intention to pass on costs to customers.

### 1. Current Business Model

Safran operates across three primary segments: Aerospace Propulsion, Aircraft Equipment, Defense and Aerosystems, and Aircraft Interiors. The company's business model is predominantly Business-to-Business (B2B), serving a diverse global customer base.

*   **Primary Products/Services:**
    *   **Aerospace Propulsion:** This segment is Safran's largest revenue driver, accounting for approximately 49.26% of its 2024 revenue. Key products include commercial and military aircraft engines, spare parts, helicopter engines (e.g., turboshaft engines, jet engines for training and support aircraft), and auxiliary power units (APUs). Notably, Safran holds a leading global market share in aircraft engines through its 50/50 joint venture with GE Aviation, CFM International, which produces the LEAP engine for the Boeing 737 MAX and Airbus A320neo, commanding about 70% of the narrow-body market.
    *   **Aircraft Equipment, Defense and Aerosystems:** This diversified segment contributes approximately 38.31% of 2024 revenue. Products include landing gear (where Safran is a world leader), wheels and carbon brakes, braking control and hydraulic systems, wiring, electrical power generation, distribution, and management systems, flight control actuators, cockpit equipment, air conditioning systems, and critical software. For defense, Safran provides tactical drones, optics, electronics, missile systems, optronics, avionics, and navigation systems.
    *   **Aircraft Interiors:** This segment, representing about 10.96% of 2024 revenue, offers passenger seats, cabin systems, and in-flight entertainment systems, along with interior retrofit services.
    *   **Space:** Safran is also involved in the space market, providing launch vehicle, spacecraft, and missile propulsion systems, electric propulsion systems, and high-performance optics for astronomy and space applications.
    *   **Services:** The company generates a significant proportion of its sales and profitability from maintenance, repair, and overhaul (MRO) services and the sale of spare parts.

*   **Key Customers and Markets:** Safran serves a global customer base, including major airplane and helicopter manufacturers (e.g., Boeing, Airbus, Bombardier, Gulfstream, Textron Aviation, Bell, Sikorsky), airlines, cargo carriers, armed forces, governments, and space agencies (e.g., European Space Agency). Geographically, the United States is Safran's largest single country market, accounting for 25.06% (€6.95 billion) of its 2024 revenue, followed by Europe (22.67%) and France (18.73%).

*   **Supply Chain Dependencies:** Safran relies on a vast network of nearly 14,000 suppliers globally. The company has acknowledged vulnerabilities to disruptions in its complex global supply chains, facing challenges in securing raw materials such as steel, aluminum, titanium, resins, and semiconductors. Safran is actively working to reduce dependence on foreign suppliers for critical components, as evidenced by its new Safran Blades factory in Belgium.

*   **Competitive Position:** Safran holds leading positions in its core markets. Through CFM International, it is the world leader in engines for single-aisle mainline commercial jets. It is also a world leader in helicopter turbine engines and landing gear. Key competitors include General Electric (GE Aerospace), Rolls-Royce, Raytheon Technologies, Honeywell Aerospace, and MTU Aero Engines AG.

### 2. Direct Impact Assessment

The US Department of Commerce initiated a Section 232 investigation on May 1, 2025, to determine if imports of commercial aircraft, jet engines, and parts threaten to impair US national security. This investigation could lead to the imposition of new tariffs, quotas, price floors, or other trade restrictions.

*   **How Tariffs Would Affect Specific Products/Services:**
    *   **Propulsion Systems:** As a major supplier of jet engines, particularly through CFM International's LEAP engines for Boeing aircraft, Safran's propulsion segment (nearly 50% of revenue) would be directly impacted. Tariffs on imported engines or engine components would increase the cost of these critical parts for US-based aircraft manufacturers like Boeing.
    *   **Aircraft Equipment:** Products such as landing gear, wiring, and electrical systems supplied to US customers or integrated into aircraft assembled in the US would also face increased costs. Safran has significant manufacturing operations in the US for these products, which could mitigate some impact, but components sourced from outside the US for these facilities could still be affected.
    *   **Aftermarket Services:** While direct tariffs on services are less common, a slowdown in US aircraft sales or operations due to tariffs could indirectly reduce demand for Safran's MRO and spare parts services in the US market.

*   **Estimated Cost Increases or Revenue Losses:** The provided "Revenue Impact Potential" of 85% is a critical indicator. While only about 25% of Safran's revenue comes directly from the US, this high potential impact suggests that a significant portion of its global sales, particularly those related to commercial aircraft and jet engines, could be exposed to the investigation's outcome. This exposure likely stems from Safran's role as a Tier 1 supplier to global airframers like Boeing and Airbus. If tariffs are imposed, the cost of Safran's components for aircraft assembled in the US would rise, potentially making US-assembled aircraft less competitive globally or forcing US OEMs to absorb costs. A 25% tariff, as seen in other Section 232 actions, could lead to substantial cost increases. For example, if 85% of Safran's €27.31 billion revenue is exposed, a 25% tariff on that portion could theoretically represent a significant cost burden, potentially in the billions of euros, depending on how much of that cost is absorbed versus passed on.

*   **Impact on Profit Margins:** Increased costs due to tariffs, if not fully passed on, would directly erode Safran's profit margins. Even if costs are passed on, competitive pressures in the aerospace industry might limit the extent to which this is feasible without impacting sales volume. Safran reported an adjusted EBITDA margin of 18.0% in 2024. Any significant unmitigated cost increase would put downward pressure on this margin.

*   **Potential for Passing Costs to Customers:** Safran has indicated that tariff impacts are currently excluded from its guidance, but the company *plans to pass these costs onto customers*. The ability to successfully pass on costs depends on several factors:
    *   **Contractual Agreements:** Existing long-term contracts with OEMs and airlines may have clauses that allow for price adjustments based on changes in trade policy or raw material costs.
    *   **Pricing Power:** Safran's strong market position, particularly in narrow-body aircraft engines through CFM International, provides it with some pricing power.
    *   **Customer Willingness:** Customers (airlines, aircraft manufacturers) may be reluctant to absorb significant price increases, potentially leading to negotiations, delayed orders, or a search for alternative suppliers if available.
    *   **Competitive Landscape:** If competitors are not similarly affected or can absorb costs more effectively, Safran's ability to pass on costs might be constrained.

### 3. Strategic Response Options

Safran has several strategic options to mitigate the impact of potential US tariffs:

*   **Business Model Adjustments:**
    *   **Increased US Production:** Safran already has a significant US manufacturing footprint, with over 10,000 employees across 26 states and facilities producing wire harnesses, electrical systems, and assembling helicopter engines. Expanding these existing facilities or establishing new ones for products directly targeted by tariffs could help "localize" production and avoid import duties. The recent opening of a new manufacturing facility in Colorado for electric propulsion systems for US defense and commercial customers, with shipments starting in 2026, demonstrates a commitment to US-based production.
    *   **Focus on Aftermarket Services:** The aftermarket segment (MRO, spare parts) is a significant revenue and profitability driver. While not immune to overall market slowdowns, it might be less directly impacted by new tariffs on new aircraft or engines. Safran could further emphasize and expand its MRO capabilities in the US.

*   **Supply Chain Diversification Strategies:**
    *   **Reshoring/Nearshoring:** Shifting more production or sourcing of critical components to the US or other non-tariff-affected regions could reduce exposure. Safran is already working to reduce dependence on foreign suppliers for critical components, as seen with its new blade factory in Belgium. This strategy could be accelerated for US-bound products.
    *   **Dual Sourcing:** Identifying and qualifying alternative suppliers outside of potentially tariff-affected regions to ensure continuity of supply and competitive pricing.
    *   **Inventory Management:** Building up strategic inventories of critical components ahead of potential tariff implementation, though this carries inventory holding costs and risks.

*   **Geographic Expansion or Contraction:**
    *   **Strengthening Non-US Markets:** While the US is a major market, Safran's diversified geographic revenue (Europe, Asia, Africa & Middle East, other Americas) provides some resilience. Further strengthening market share and partnerships in these regions could offset potential US market contraction.
    *   **Strategic Partnerships:** Deepening existing partnerships (e.g., with Airbus in Europe) and exploring new collaborations in other regions to share risks and leverage local supply chains.

*   **Product/Service Modifications:**
    *   **Component Localization:** Designing products to allow for easier localization of component manufacturing within the US, reducing the need for imported parts subject to tariffs.
    *   **Innovation in Efficiency:** Continuing to invest in R&D for more fuel-efficient and environmentally friendly solutions, which could provide a competitive edge regardless of tariff implications, as demand for such products is growing.

### 4. Risk Factors

Safran faces several inherent and emerging risk factors, exacerbated by the Section 232 investigation:

*   **Vulnerability to Supply Chain Disruptions:** Even without tariffs, Safran's reliance on a complex global supply chain makes it vulnerable to disruptions from geopolitical events, natural disasters, or raw material shortages (e.g., steel, aluminum, titanium, resins, semiconductors). Tariffs would add a new layer of complexity and cost to these existing vulnerabilities.
*   **Dependence on Specific Markets or Customers:** While diversified, the significant revenue contribution from the US (25.06%) and the high "Revenue Impact Potential" (85%) highlight a substantial dependence on the US market and major US OEMs like Boeing. Any significant downturn or trade barrier in this market would have a material impact.
*   **Regulatory or Compliance Challenges:** Navigating complex international trade regulations and potential new tariff regimes would increase compliance costs and administrative burdens. The Section 232 investigation itself introduces regulatory uncertainty.
*   **Competitive Threats or Opportunities:**
    *   **Threats:** If tariffs disproportionately affect Safran compared to its non-European competitors (e.g., US-based GE Aerospace for engines, or other global players with more localized US production), it could lose market share.
    *   **Opportunities:** Conversely, if the tariffs primarily target non-US imports and Safran can leverage its existing US manufacturing base or expand it rapidly, it could gain a competitive advantage over other foreign suppliers. The company's stated intent to pass on costs suggests a belief in its pricing power, but this could be tested by competitive dynamics.

### 5. Long-term Implications

The outcome of the Section 232 investigation could have profound long-term implications for Safran:

*   **Potential for Market Share Gains or Losses:**
    *   **Losses:** If tariffs are imposed and Safran cannot fully pass on costs or localize production sufficiently, its products could become less competitive in the US market, leading to market share erosion, particularly for new aircraft programs.
    *   **Gains:** If the tariffs lead to a broader restructuring of the aerospace supply chain, and Safran strategically invests in US production and strengthens its local partnerships, it could potentially gain market share from competitors less able to adapt.
*   **Investment and Expansion Opportunities:** The threat of tariffs could accelerate Safran's existing strategy of increasing its US manufacturing footprint and diversifying its supply chain. This could lead to significant capital expenditures in the US, creating new jobs and strengthening its position as a domestic supplier for US defense and commercial aerospace.
*   **Strategic Partnerships or Acquisitions:** Safran may seek to deepen existing partnerships or pursue new acquisitions in the US to enhance its local presence, secure supply chains, and mitigate tariff risks. Its recent acquisition of part of Collins Aerospace's actuation business, which involved divesting its North American THSA business to address competition concerns, shows its strategic approach to portfolio management and market presence.
*   **Innovation and R&D Implications:** While tariffs might initially divert resources to supply chain adjustments, Safran's long-term commitment to R&D, particularly in sustainable aviation technologies and green propulsion systems, is crucial for maintaining its competitive edge. The need to optimize products for localized production or to reduce material dependencies could also spur innovation in design and manufacturing processes. The company's focus on digital transformation and AI applications (e.g., acquisition of Preligens, now Safran.AI) will also be key for long-term efficiency and competitiveness.

In conclusion, the US Section 232 investigation poses a significant risk to Safran S.A., given its substantial exposure to the commercial aircraft and jet engine market and its strong presence in the US. While the company aims to pass on costs, the ultimate impact will depend on the severity of any tariffs, the elasticity of demand, and Safran's ability to strategically adapt its production and supply chain. Long-term success will hinge on its agility in localizing production, diversifying its supply chain, and continuing to innovate in a potentially more fragmented global aerospace market.
