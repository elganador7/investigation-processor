### 2. Direct Impact Assessment

The Section 232 investigation targets *imports* of commercial aircraft and jet engines. While Howmet is a U.S.-based supplier of *components*, the imposition of tariffs or restrictions on finished imported goods could have significant indirect and direct consequences.

*   **How Tariffs Would Affect Specific Products/Services:**
    *   **Reduced Demand for U.S.-Made Aircraft/Engines:** If tariffs are imposed on imported aircraft and engines, it could theoretically make U.S.-produced aircraft and engines more competitive domestically. However, the global nature of the aerospace industry means that major U.S. OEMs (e.g., Boeing) also rely heavily on international sales. If retaliatory tariffs are imposed by other countries on U.S. aerospace exports, or if global demand for aircraft declines due to increased costs, it would directly reduce production rates for Howmet's customers, thereby decreasing demand for Howmet's fasteners, engine products, and structures.
    *   **Supply Chain Re-evaluation:** U.S. aircraft and engine manufacturers might re-evaluate their global supply chains. If tariffs lead to a push for more domestic content, Howmet, as a U.S. supplier, could potentially see increased demand from U.S. OEMs. Conversely, if OEMs seek to offset tariff costs by sourcing components from lower-cost regions or regions unaffected by tariffs, Howmet could face reduced orders.
    *   **Impact on International Customers:** Howmet supplies components to non-U.S. aircraft and engine manufacturers (e.g., Airbus, Rolls-Royce). If these manufacturers face tariffs when exporting to the U.S., their overall production volumes could be affected, leading to reduced orders for Howmet's components.

*   **Estimated Cost Increases or Revenue Losses:** The prompt states a "Revenue Impact Potential: 75%." This indicates that approximately 75% of Howmet's $7.43 billion annual revenue, or roughly $5.57 billion, is derived from the commercial aerospace sector, making it highly vulnerable to shifts in this market.
    *   **Revenue Loss:** A significant downturn in commercial aircraft production rates, even a modest percentage, could translate into hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue loss for Howmet. For example, a 10% reduction in commercial aerospace demand due to tariffs could lead to a revenue decline of approximately $557 million.
    *   **Cost Increases:** While the tariffs are on finished goods, indirect cost increases could arise from:
        *   **Supply Chain Disruptions:** If tariffs lead to a scramble for alternative suppliers or raw materials, the cost of these inputs could rise.
        *   **Logistics Costs:** Increased trade barriers could lead to higher shipping and customs costs.

*   **Impact on Profit Margins:** Any significant revenue decline, coupled with potential cost increases, would directly compress Howmet's profit margins. The aerospace industry typically involves long-term contracts and high fixed costs (e.g., R&D, specialized machinery). A sudden drop in volume would make it harder to absorb these fixed costs, leading to lower operating leverage and reduced profitability.

*   **Potential for Passing Costs to Customers:** Howmet operates in a highly specialized and competitive market where pricing power can be limited, especially with large, powerful OEMs. While some long-term contracts may have escalation clauses, passing on significant cost increases due to tariff-induced market shifts would be challenging. OEMs are under constant pressure to reduce costs, and they would likely resist price increases from their suppliers. This suggests Howmet would likely bear a significant portion of any increased costs or reduced margins.

Shifting resources, R&D, and production capacity towards defense programs could provide a more stable revenue stream, as defense spending is often less susceptible to trade disputes.
    *   **Diversification into Non-Aerospace Markets:** Exploring opportunities in other high-precision, high-performance industries that utilize similar materials and manufacturing processes (e.g., industrial gas turbines, medical implants, automotive performance parts) could reduce reliance on commercial aerospace.

*   **Supply Chain Diversification Strategies:**
    *   **Reshoring/Nearshoring:** If tariffs incentivize domestic production, Howmet could explore increasing its U.S.-based raw material sourcing and manufacturing capabilities to reduce reliance on potentially tariff-affected international suppliers.
    *   **Dual Sourcing:** For critical components and raw materials, establishing relationships with multiple suppliers in different geographic regions can reduce vulnerability to disruptions and price volatility.
    *   **Inventory Management:** Strategically increasing inventory of critical raw materials or finished components could buffer against short-term supply chain shocks.

*   **Geographic Expansion or Contraction:**
    *   **Localized Production:** For certain products, establishing or expanding manufacturing facilities within key customer regions (e.g., Europe for Airbus) could help circumvent future trade barriers and strengthen customer relationships.
    *   **Strategic Partnerships:** Forming alliances with international partners could help navigate complex trade environments and access new markets or supply chains.

*   **Product/Service Modifications:**
    *   **Innovation for Cost Reduction:** Investing in R&D to develop more cost-effective manufacturing processes or lighter, more durable materials could help Howmet maintain competitiveness even if its customers face increased costs.
