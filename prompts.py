    Provide a rigorous, data-driven CURRENT MARKET ASSESSMENT suitable for an expert audience (assume the reader is a senior financial analyst, investor, or policymaker). Your analysis should include:
    - Total addressable market size in USD (global and US), with breakdowns by segment and recent CAGR. Reference authoritative sources and provide explicit assumptions.
    - Detailed analysis of current US import/export flows in this sector, including key HS codes, top trading partners, and recent trends. Quantify exposure to tariff risk.
    - Estimate the precise portion of the US market (by value and volume) that would be subject to tariffs if enacted, including downstream and indirect supply chain effects. Discuss substitution elasticity and potential for circumvention.
    - Identify and rank key market participants by market share, using the latest available data. Include both public and private firms, and discuss market concentration (e.g., HHI).
    - Analyze current trade patterns, major exporting/importing countries, and structural dependencies or vulnerabilities.
    
    Use advanced financial and market analysis frameworks where appropriate (e.g., Porterâ€™s Five Forces, value chain analysis). Clearly state all assumptions, cite data sources, and highlight areas of uncertainty or debate. Provide actionable insights and implications for sophisticated stakeholders.

    Provide a granular, scenario-based TARIFF IMPACT ANALYSIS for each tariff rate (10%, 25%, 50%), suitable for a financially sophisticated audience:
    - Quantify the estimated incremental cost to the US market under each scenario, assuming static trade patterns. Use sensitivity analysis to model key variables.
    - Critically assess the capacity and constraints of US companies to substitute for imports, including capital intensity, lead times, and regulatory barriers.
    - Model the expected shift in consumption to domestic markets, considering price elasticity of demand and supply, and potential for demand destruction or substitution.
    - Analyze the impact on supply chain structure, production costs, and gross margins for key industry segments.
    - Estimate the pass-through of tariff costs to end consumers, using historical analogs and economic theory.
    - Assess the aggregate demand impact in the US market, referencing macroeconomic multipliers and sectoral linkages.
    
    Support your analysis with quantitative models, explicit assumptions, and references to relevant academic or industry research. Highlight second-order effects, strategic responses by market participants, and discuss data limitations and uncertainties.
