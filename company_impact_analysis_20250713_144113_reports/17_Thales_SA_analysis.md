### 2. Direct Impact Assessment: Potential Tariffs/Restrictions

The potential revenue impact of 20% on Thales' $19.5 billion annual revenue translates to a staggering **$3.9 billion potential revenue loss**. This figure underscores the severity of the potential impact.

*   **How Tariffs Would Affect Specific Products/Services:**
    *   **Indirect Impact (Most Likely):** If tariffs are imposed on *finished commercial aircraft* imported into the U.S. (e.g., Airbus aircraft), it would make these aircraft significantly more expensive for U.S. airlines. This would likely lead to a reduction in U.S. orders for non-U.S. manufactured aircraft. Since Thales supplies critical components (avionics, electrical systems, IFE) to these aircraft, a decline in aircraft sales directly translates to reduced demand for Thales' systems.
    *   **Direct Impact (Less Likely but Possible):** If the investigation broadens to include specific *components* or if the tariffs are structured to target components based on their country of origin, Thales' direct exports of avionics, electrical systems, or IFE to U.S.-based aircraft manufacturers (e.g., Boeing) or U.S. airlines would become more expensive. This would directly impact Thales' competitiveness against U.S. suppliers like Collins Aerospace (RTX) or Honeywell.
    *   **Impact on Aftermarket Services:** Reduced fleet sizes of non-U.S. aircraft in the U.S. or a shift towards U.S.-made aircraft could also impact Thales' aftermarket services (maintenance, repair, overhaul) for its installed base.

*   **Estimated Cost Increases or Revenue Losses:**
    *   **Revenue Loss:** As stated, a potential **$3.9 billion** in annual revenue. This would primarily stem from reduced sales volumes of its aerospace components and systems to affected aircraft programs.
    *   **Cost Increases:**
        *   If Thales needs to re-source components from non-tariffed regions or establish new manufacturing capabilities in the U.S. to avoid tariffs, this would incur significant capital expenditure and operational costs.
        *   Increased logistics and administrative costs associated with navigating complex tariff regimes.

*   **Impact on Profit Margins:**
    *   A $3.9 billion revenue hit would severely impact Thales' overall profitability. Even with cost-cutting measures, the sheer scale of the potential revenue loss would lead to significant margin erosion.
    *   The aerospace sector typically involves long sales cycles and high R&D costs. Reduced sales volumes would mean fixed costs are spread over fewer units, further compressing margins.
    *   Thales' ability to maintain its R&D investment, crucial for its competitive edge, could be jeopardized.

*   **Potential for Passing Costs to Customers:**
    *   **Limited Ability:** Passing on tariff-related cost increases to major aircraft manufacturers (OEMs) or airlines is highly challenging. These customers operate on tight margins, have long-term contracts, and possess significant bargaining power.
    *   **Competitive Pressure:** OEMs would likely push back, potentially seeking alternative suppliers (especially U.S.-based ones) if Thales' components become uncompetitive due to tariffs.
    *   **Contractual Obligations:** Existing long-term supply contracts may not allow for easy price adjustments due to unforeseen tariffs.
