### 2. Direct Impact Assessment

The Section 232 investigation targets "imports of commercial aircraft and jet engines, and parts for commercial aircraft and jet engines" into the US. This broad scope directly implicates Lisi Aerospace's products.

*   **Impact on Specific Products/Services:**
    *   **Direct Tariffs:** If the US imposes tariffs on imported aerospace components, Lisi Aerospace's direct exports of fasteners (e.g., bolts, nuts, rivets, blind fasteners, lockbolts) and structural components (e.g., machined parts for airframes and engines) to US-based OEMs (e.g., Boeing, GE Aerospace) would face increased costs. This would make Lisi's products more expensive for US customers compared to domestic alternatives, potentially reducing Lisi's sales volume to the US market.
    *   **Indirect Demand Reduction:** More significantly, if tariffs are imposed on *finished* commercial aircraft and jet engines imported into the US (e.g., from Airbus or Safran), it would likely reduce demand for these aircraft in the US market. This would cascade down the supply chain, leading to reduced orders for Lisi's components from its major OEM customers globally, regardless of Lisi's direct export status to the US. The aerospace industry has warned that such tariffs could "weaken our economic and national security" and "have a material and debilitating impact on the domestic commercial aviation industry's ability to grow, compete, innovate and invest".
*   **Materials and Products Supporting:** Lisi's products are manufactured from specialized alloys like titanium and aluminum. While the current investigation focuses on finished products and parts, previous Section 232 tariffs on steel and aluminum have already inflated production costs for the aerospace sector. Any new tariffs would compound these cost pressures, particularly if they target specific high-performance alloys or processed forms.
*   **Potential for Passing Costs to Customers:** Passing on tariff-related cost increases to customers is challenging. Aerospace contracts are often long-term, and OEMs have significant bargaining power due to their concentrated purchasing volume. While Lisi has demonstrated some ability to pass through inflation on sales prices, tariffs represent an external, politically driven cost. OEMs may resist absorbing these costs, potentially leading to margin compression for Lisi or pressure to shift sourcing to non-tariffed suppliers.

### 3. Strategic Response Options

*   **Potential Business Model Adjustments:**
    *   **Diversify End Markets:** Increase focus on the defense and space sectors, which are less susceptible to commercial trade disputes and already represent a portion of Lisi Aerospace's sales.
    *   **Expand MRO (Maintenance, Repair, and Overhaul) Business:** MRO activities are less sensitive to new aircraft delivery fluctuations and could provide a more stable revenue stream, especially if tariffs lead to extended lifecycles for existing aircraft.
*   **Supply Chain Diversification Strategies:**
    *   **Geographic Sourcing:** While Lisi already has a global footprint, further diversify raw material and sub-component sourcing to reduce reliance on regions potentially impacted by US tariffs or retaliatory measures.
    *   **Localized Production:** Evaluate the feasibility and cost-benefit of increasing production capacity within the US (Lisi already has US facilities) to serve US customers directly and mitigate tariff impacts on imports. This could involve expanding existing US sites or strategic acquisitions.
*   **Geographic Expansion or Contraction:**
    *   **Focus on Non-US Growth Markets:** Intensify sales and marketing efforts in rapidly growing aerospace markets in Asia-Pacific (e.g., China, India), where aviation industries are expanding rapidly. Lisi already has a presence in China and India.
